# entry

the entry point of the compiler is in main.c and basically all we got here right now is an inclusion of types.h idk why this header is called that because theres more htan just types but wtever lol anyways we take 2 typical c arguments int argc char argv, count how many files are given and then call the process_files function which is in lexer.c
