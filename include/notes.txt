what keywords should tehre be and what tokens should tehre be

keys:

--code--

- source (include another file)
- asm (inline assembly)
- return (probably will be required)
- sizeof (cool unary)
- ; (semicolon line terminator)

--comparison & comments--

- < (less than greater than)
- > (greater than less than)
- =< (less than equal to)
- >= (greater than equal to)
- // (comments per line)
- /* */ (multiline comment)
- = (equal value assigner)
- == (equal value checker)
- ? (i forgot what this does ngl)

--mathematical data types--

- auto (auto type)
- int (signed int)
- uint (unsigned int)
- const type (a constant of a type)
- double (bigger data)
- extern type (use it across files this piece of data)
- long type (bigger type)
- longlong (bigger type)
- short (small number)
- shortshort (really short number might convert to base 2 for because funny)
- float (decimal number)

--linguistic? data types--

- string (yes this isnt just C but dookie)
- char (1 character)
- enum (enumeration we know what this does)
- struct (we also know what this does lol)
- union (ngl i havent used this in a HOT minute forgot what this does)
- array (hardcoded length of stuff)
- vector (dynamic array im not sure if this will exist but it would be fun to implement)

--logic--

- break (die)
- while (do something while boolean true)
- for (do something while arithmetic and logic happens)
- case (case a do this yk)
- do (do a thingy)
- else (do i have to explain this)
- if (do i have to explain this too)
- switch (switch case break yk the drill)
- elif (just else if yk)
- default (default case in a switch case setup)


--computation--
(I might add a few constants built in the language or something like Euler, or Pi, or Tau (i think thats what its called?), and imaginary numbers, idk)

--preprocessor macros--
(I could do these but its a lot of work probably)

--pointers--
i gotta figure that out thsi will be wack to implement

--brackets n stuff--

- { (open a piece of logic)
- } (close the piece of logic)
- ( (same sort of rigamaroll)
- ) (same sort of rigamaroll)
